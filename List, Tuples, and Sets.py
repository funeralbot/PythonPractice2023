#List, Sets, and Tumples are different collections that allow us to store multiple values in a single variable
l = ["Bob", "Rolf", "Anne"] #list can have elements added and removed
#list are the most common because you can add and remove elements

t = ("Bob", "Rolf", "Anne") #tuples are set and cannot be changed

s = {"Bob", "Rolf", "Anne"} #you can add and remove elements from a set but you cannot have duplicate elements in a set
#the order of a set is not always guarenteed

print(l[0]) #subscript notation }

l.append("Smith") #add elements to a list with the append function

l.remove("Bob") #remove elements from a list

s.add("Smith") #add elements to a set
